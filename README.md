# ExcelAutomation
Quick tutorial I took on how to automate excel with Python. The tutor was Tim from the YouTube channel Tech with Tim, so all credits for this project go to him!

What I learned:
- how to connect excel with Python/Pycharm
- how to work with excel sheets using the language
- working/modifying with excel data
